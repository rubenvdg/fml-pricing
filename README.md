# Price Optimization under the Finite-Mixture Logit model

This repository contains the implementation of the branch-and-bound algorithm described in our paper "Price Optimization under the Finite-Mixture Logit Model" (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3235432).

The code is developed and tested under:
+ Python 3.6.5
+ Numpy 1.14.5
+ Scipy 1.1.0
+ cvxopt 1.2.0
