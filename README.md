# Price Optimization under the Finite-Mixture Logit model

This repository contains the implementation of the branch-and-bound algorithm described in our paper "Price Optimization under the Finite-Mixture Logit Model" (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3235432).

The code is developed and tested under:
+ Python 3.6.5
+ NumPy 1.14.5
+ SciPy 1.1.0
+ CVXOPT 1.2.0

The algorithm is contained in `bnb.py` (an example of an instantiation of the algorithm can be found at the bottom of the file).
